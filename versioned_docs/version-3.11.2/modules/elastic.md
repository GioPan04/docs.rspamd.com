# Elasticsearch module

Elasticsearch module pushes a variety of message-related metadata to an instance of [Elasticsearch](https://elastic.co/) or [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/).

Additionally module manages index template & policy and ingest pipeline for geoip functionality.

## Requirements
- Supported version of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) or [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) - Indexing database
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) or [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/) (optional) - Used for data visualization

## Configuration

Starting from version Rspamd 3.11.0 module is disabled by default and should be explicitly `enabled` via `local.d/elastic.conf` or `override.d/elastic.conf`.

*Important:* by default module configures `index_policy` to delete logs older then 30 days.
If you are updating from version 3.10.x or older and want to use a different index policy - please configure it before enabling this module.

By default, the module automatically detects the distribution and whether the server version is supported, this behaviour can be disabled by setting `autodetect_enabled` to `false`, then it will take version of distribution from configuration.

Automatic index template managment as well as index policy and geoip pipeline can be turned off by setting `managed` to `false` in corresponding config section.

If you want to use your own existing index policy but keep a managed index template - you can set index policy `managed` to `false` and change the `name` of the policy to your custom one.

If you don't want to use index policy at all you need disable it by setting `enabled` to `false` in corresponding config section, same applies for geoip.
