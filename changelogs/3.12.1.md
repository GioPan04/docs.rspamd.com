title: "Minor Release with Bug Fixes and Improvements"
---

## Added
- **Bayes Classifiers Endpoint**: Add `/bayes/classifiers` HTTP endpoint for better classifier management
- **Enhanced Scheduling**: Further improvements in scheduling next checks for better performance
- **AEAD Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) used in Rspamd
- **Improved Maps Consistency**: Better consistency in cached flag for maps and logging when dealing with Expires

## Improved
- **Maps Locking**: Eliminate maps locking for better performance and reduced contention
- **Proxy Headers**: Fix proxy headers duplication and improve header handling
- **Milter Logic**: Do not add log tag header in milter logic for cleaner output
- **Connection Handling**: Do not explicitly add Connection header if it's already present
- **Attachment Processing**: Treat *.library-ms and *.search-ms attachments as harmful (with proper application)
- **Maps Concurrent Loading**: Fix race conditions in maps concurrent loading
- **Write Operations**: Try to avoid incomplete writes for better data integrity

## Fixed
- **Maps Locking Issues**: Eliminate maps locking to prevent deadlocks and improve performance
- **Proxy Headers Duplication**: Fix proxy headers duplication issue
- **Milter Header Logic**: Fix logic error in milter_headers.lua: skip_wanted() function
- **Connection Header**: Prevent duplicate Connection headers in proxy
- **Maps Concurrent Access**: Fix race conditions in maps concurrent loading
- **Incomplete Writes**: Prevent incomplete writes that could cause data corruption
- **Attachment Security**: Properly apply security rules for *.library-ms and *.search-ms attachments
- **Logging Consistency**: Improve consistency in logging when dealing with Expires and cached flags

## Changed
- **Maps Architecture**: Eliminate maps locking mechanism for better performance
- **Header Processing**: Improve header processing to avoid duplicates
- **Attachment Handling**: Enhanced security for Windows library and search attachments
- **Scheduling Logic**: Improved scheduling algorithm for next checks
- **Logging Format**: Better consistency in logging output and cached flag handling

## Security
- **Attachment Security**: Enhanced protection against potentially harmful Windows library and search attachments
- **Header Validation**: Improved header validation to prevent duplication and injection
- **Write Protection**: Better protection against incomplete writes that could lead to data corruption

## Performance
- **Maps Performance**: Eliminate maps locking for better concurrent access performance
- **Scheduling**: Improved scheduling algorithm for better resource utilization
- **Header Processing**: Optimized header processing to reduce overhead

## Testing
- **AEAD Testing**: Comprehensive tests for AEAD encryption used throughout Rspamd
- **Maps Testing**: Improved testing for maps concurrent loading scenarios
- **Header Testing**: Better testing for header processing and duplication scenarios

This minor release focuses on stability improvements, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. The elimination of maps locking provides significant performance improvements for high-concurrency environments, while the enhanced attachment security and header processing improvements make Rspamd more robust and secure.
