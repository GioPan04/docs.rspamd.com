# Contributing to rspamd.com website

For general instructions on building and contributing to the Rspamd website, please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd.com/wiki/Building-the-site).

The following document provides specific guidelines on handling local links and testing changes before submitting pull requests.

## Local links

During the build process, Markdown sources are converted into HTML pages, and their file extensions are changed from `*.md` to `*.html`. When creating local links, ensure to replace the `.md` file extension with `.html`.

To maintain website portability, utilize the `site.url` and `site.baseurl` variables when creating local links. Absolute local links should start with &nbsp;site.url&nbsp;}}&nbsp;site.baseurl&nbsp;}}, while root-relative links should begin with &nbsp;site.baseurl&nbsp;}}:

| Correct | Incorrect |
| ------- | --------- |
| `[link](}}}}/dir/doc.html)` | `[link](https://rspamd.com/dir/doc.html)` |
| `[link](}}/dir/doc.html)` | `[link](/dir/doc.html)` |
